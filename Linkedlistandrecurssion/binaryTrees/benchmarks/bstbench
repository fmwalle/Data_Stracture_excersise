Given a binary tree, write a function that computes the maximum sum on any path from the root to a leaf, considering only every other value.
 The root is always included, the second level values are not, the third level is, etc.

     1
    / \
   9   1
  /   / \
 1   2   3
For this tree, the result is 4 (1 + 3), since the 9 is excluded, so the left branch from the root only results in a 2. There are two possible sums on the right but the second results in total of 3.



. Given a binary tree, return the sum of the level whose values add up to the highest sum.

     5
   2   6
  1 3    8
        7
returns 12 because 1 + 3 + 8 is the largest sum of any level in the tree.
