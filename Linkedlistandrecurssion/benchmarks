Given a linked list, return the value of the middle node. If there are an even number of nodes, return the 2nd middle node.

You are allowed to only make 1 pass through the linked list.

Example:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 4


Given a linked list, swap the head (first element) and the tail (last element) of the linked list, and return the new head.

Example:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [6,2,3,4,5,1]
