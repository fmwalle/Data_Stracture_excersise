Given any string str, sort the characters in descending order based on the number of occurrences of each character in the string str.

Return an array of the characters in order. You may assume each character has a distinct frequency.

eg: "gggghhleee" => ["g", "e", "h", "l"]

g is the only letter with a frequency of 4
e is the only letter with a frequency of 3
h is the only letter with a frequency of 2
l is the only letter with a frequency of 1
