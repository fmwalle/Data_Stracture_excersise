Given a string and a non-empty substring *sub*, compute recursively if at least n copies of sub appear in the string somewhere, possibly with overlapping. N will be non-negative.

Example(s)
strCopies("catcowcat", "cat", 2) == True
strCopies("catcowcat", "cow", 2) == False
strCopies("catcowcat", "cow", 1) == True
